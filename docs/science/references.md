# References

Complete bibliography for the fair-shares project. All citations are drawn from curated rubrics reviewed for climate equity scholarship.

**Note on scope:** We draw on a subset of the climate equity literature. The sources cited here represent illustrative examples from a broader scholarly conversation. This collection will be expanded as the project develops.

For context on how these inform allocation approaches, see:

- [Climate Equity Concepts](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/climate-equity-concepts/)
- [Allocation Approaches](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/allocations/)
- [Other Operations](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/other-operations/)

Inline citations in `docs/science/` use `[Author YYYY]` format.
