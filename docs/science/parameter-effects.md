# Parameter Effects Reference

This guide shows how key parameters affect allocation outcomes using real data for representative countries:

- **USA**: High historical emissions, high GDP per capita
- **India**: Large population, lower historical emissions per capita
- **Germany**: Medium population, high historical emissions and GDP per capita

All examples use real data from PRIMAP (emissions), UN/OWID (population), World Bank (GDP), and UNU-WIDER (Gini).

**Reproducing examples:** Examples are generated by `notebooks/docs/parameter_effects_examples.py`. Run `uv run python notebooks/docs/parameter_effects_examples.py` to regenerate with updated data.

## allocation_year (Budget) / first_allocation_year (Pathway)

**Effect:** Earlier allocation years increase the weight of historical population patterns. For equal-per-capita approaches, this affects shares based on when countries had different population distributions.

**Direction:**

- Earlier years → Allocations reflect historical population distributions
- Later years → Allocations reflect current population distributions

**Example:** `equal-per-capita-budget` with varying `allocation_year`

| Country | allocation_year=2020 | allocation_year=1990 | allocation_year=1900 |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| USA     | 4.0%                 | 4.1%                 | 4.4%                 |
| India   | 16.7%                | 16.9%                | 16.7%                |
| Germany | 0.8%                 | 0.9%                 | 1.2%                 |

_Example uses 1.5°C carbon budget (50% probability) allocated from 2025._

**Key insight:** For equal-per-capita allocation, the `allocation_year` has limited effect because population shares are relatively stable. The parameter's main effect is determining when the allocation "clock starts" - earlier years mean countries are responsible for their full historical emissions before that date.

## responsibility_weight

**Effect:** Controls the strength of historical responsibility adjustments. Higher values penalize countries with high cumulative historical emissions.

**Direction:**

- `weight=0.0` → No historical responsibility adjustment (equal per capita)
- `weight=0.5` → Moderate adjustment based on historical emissions
- `weight=1.0` → Full adjustment (maximum penalty for historical emissions)

**Example:** `per-capita-adjusted-budget` varying `responsibility_weight` (with `capability_weight=0.0`)

| Country | weight=0.0 | weight=0.5 | weight=1.0 |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| USA     | 4.0%       | 0.5%       | 0.5%       |
| India   | 16.7%      | 8.2%       | 8.2%       |
| Germany | 0.8%       | 0.1%       | 0.1%       |

_Example uses `allocation_year=2020`, `historical_responsibility_year=1990`._

**Key insight:** Historical responsibility dramatically reduces shares for high-emitting developed countries (USA: 4.0% → 0.5%, Germany: 0.8% → 0.1%) while increasing shares for countries with lower historical emissions (India: 16.7% → 8.2%). The effect saturates between `weight=0.5` and `weight=1.0` in this example because historical emissions differences are so large.

**Theoretical basis:** See [Polluter Pays / Historical Responsibility](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/climate-equity-concepts/#polluter-pays-historical-responsibility)

## capability_weight

**Effect:** Controls the strength of capability (ability to pay) adjustments. Higher values reduce allocations for wealthy countries.

**Direction:**

- `weight=0.0` → No capability adjustment (equal per capita)
- `weight=0.5` → Moderate adjustment based on GDP per capita
- `weight=1.0` → Full adjustment (maximum reduction for high GDP)

**Example:** `per-capita-adjusted-budget` varying `capability_weight` (with `responsibility_weight=0.0`)

| Country | weight=0.0 | weight=0.5 | weight=1.0 |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| USA     | 4.0%       | 3.4%       | 3.4%       |
| India   | 16.7%      | 16.9%      | 16.9%      |
| Germany | 0.8%       | 0.7%       | 0.7%       |

_Example uses `allocation_year=2020`._

**Key insight:** Capability adjustments have a smaller magnitude effect than historical responsibility adjustments. Wealthy countries see modest reductions (USA: 4.0% → 3.4%, Germany: 0.8% → 0.7%) while lower-GDP countries see small increases (India: 16.7% → 16.9%). The effect also saturates between `weight=0.5` and `weight=1.0`.

**Mathematical detail:** See [per_capita_adjusted_budget API](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/api/allocations/budgets/#per_capita_adjusted_budget)

**Theoretical basis:** See [Ability to Pay (Capability)](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/climate-equity-concepts/#ability-to-pay-capability)

## income_floor

**Effect:** Sets a minimum income level for capability calculations, protecting subsistence needs. Income below this threshold is excluded from capability adjustments.

**Direction:**

- `floor=0` → All income counts toward capability
- `floor=7500` → Moderate protection for basic needs
- `floor=15000` → Strong protection for basic needs

**Example:** `per-capita-adjusted-gini-budget` varying `income_floor` (with `capability_weight=0.5`)

| Country | floor=0 | floor=7500 | floor=15000 |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| USA     | 3.4%    | 3.2%       | 3.1%        |
| India   | 16.9%   | 16.5%      | 16.6%       |
| Germany | 0.7%    | 0.6%       | 0.6%        |

_Example uses `allocation_year=2020`, Gini-adjusted capability calculation._

**Key insight:** Income floor effects are modest but principled. Higher floors slightly reduce the capability penalty for wealthy countries (USA: 3.4% → 3.1%) by recognizing that subsistence needs should not count as "ability to pay". The effect is nonlinear and depends on income distribution (captured by Gini coefficients).

## Combining Parameters

Real allocation approaches combine multiple principles. Common patterns:

### Moderate Equity (Responsibility + Capability)

<!-- REFERENCE: per_capita_adjusted_budget() in src/fair_shares/library/allocations/budgets/per_capita.py -->

```python
per_capita_adjusted_budget(
    responsibility_weight=0.5,
    capability_weight=0.5,
    historical_responsibility_year=1990,
)
```

Balances historical emissions and ability to pay with equal per-capita baseline.

### Strong Historical Accountability

<!-- REFERENCE: per_capita_adjusted_budget() in src/fair_shares/library/allocations/budgets/per_capita.py -->

```python
per_capita_adjusted_budget(
    responsibility_weight=1.0,
    capability_weight=0.0,
    historical_responsibility_year=1850,  # Industrial revolution
)
```

Maximum penalty for historical emissions since industrialization.

### Development-Protective Capability

<!-- REFERENCE: per_capita_adjusted_gini_budget() in src/fair_shares/library/allocations/budgets/per_capita.py -->

```python
per_capita_adjusted_gini_budget(
    responsibility_weight=0.0,
    capability_weight=1.0,
    income_floor=7500,  # ~$20/day
)
```

Adjusts for wealth while protecting subsistence needs.

## Understanding Parameter Interactions

### Weight Saturation

As shown in the examples above, adjustment weights often saturate - differences between `weight=0.5` and `weight=1.0` can be minimal when underlying data differences are large.

### Parameter Sensitivity Ranking

Based on the examples:

1. **`responsibility_weight`** (largest effect) - Can change allocations by 3-4 percentage points
2. **`capability_weight`** (moderate effect) - Typically 0.5-1 percentage point changes
3. **`income_floor`** (smallest effect) - Typically <0.5 percentage point changes
4. **`allocation_year`** (context-dependent) - Effect depends on historical population changes

### Multi-Parameter Trade-offs

When combining adjustments:

- High responsibility weight + high capability weight → Very low allocations for developed countries
- Low responsibility weight + moderate capability weight → Focus on current capacity to act
- Responsibility alone → "Polluter pays" framing
- Capability alone → "Common but differentiated" without historical accountability
