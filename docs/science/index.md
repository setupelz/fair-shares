# Scientific Documentation

Scientific foundations and theoretical background for fair-shares allocation approaches.

---

## Choose Your Path

=== "I want to understand the tools"

    **Best path:** Start with the allocation approaches catalog to see what's available, then dive into API details for implementation.

    ### Key resources

    - **[Allocation Approaches](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/allocations/)** — Design choices and rationale for each approach
    - **[API Reference](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/api/index/)** — Function signatures, parameters, and usage details
    - **[Parameter Effects](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/parameter-effects/)** — How configuration choices affect allocations

    ### Additional resources

    - [Other Operations](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/other-operations/) — Data processing utilities
    - [Glossary](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/glossary/) — Technical terminology

=== "I want to understand principles → code"

    **Best path:** Learn the principles-first philosophy, then explore how equity concepts map to implementation.

    ### Key resources

    - **[Principle to Code](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/principle-to-code/)** — How to translate equity principles into allocation approaches
    - **[Climate Equity Concepts](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/climate-equity-concepts/)** — Underlying principles: CBDR-RC, polluter pays, capability
    - **[References](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/references/)** — Academic citations and further reading

    ### Additional resources

    - [Allocation Approaches](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/allocations/) — See principles operationalized
    - [Glossary](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/glossary/) — Climate equity terminology

=== "I want to add new functionality"

    **Best path:** Understand the principles-first requirement, then follow the developer guide for implementation.

    ### Key resources

    - **[Principle to Code](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/science/principle-to-code/)** — Understand the equity grounding requirement
    - **[Developer Guide](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/dev-guide/index/)** — Implementation patterns and contribution workflow
    - **[Adding Approaches](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/dev-guide/adding-approaches/)** — Step-by-step guide for new approaches

    ### Additional resources

    - [Docstring Template](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/dev-guide/docstring-template/) — Required documentation format
    - [Testing Checklist](https://setupelz.github.io/fair-shares/dev-guide/testing-checklist/) — Pre-submission verification
